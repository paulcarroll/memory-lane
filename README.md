## What's all this then?

This is a collection of old, old, old programming I did when I first started that I doubt anyone will find interesting... possibly some nostalgia for some older programmers and some jaw dropping for some younger ones.

Most of the code is in c++ and x86 assembly (for the younger ones, assembly is the language of the x86 intel series of processors).

If you don't know what a demo is, then check out [this great documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MexnBunH_g)


# Games

### [Space Invaders](https://github.com/paulcarroll/memory-lane/tree/master/src/games/SPC_INV)

Yep, that game.... again
Was reasonably close to being playable, maybe I'll finish it off in javascript one day.

### [Anarchy](https://github.com/paulcarroll/memory-lane/tree/master/src/games/ANARCHY)

This was the start of a 2D top-down scrolling game. As I remember it was shockingly slow, so there must've been something terribly wrong with my algorithm!

### [Bricks](https://github.com/paulcarroll/memory-lane/tree/master/src/games/BRICKS)

Classic (badly done) version of bricks (through the wall).

### [PixRace](https://github.com/paulcarroll/memory-lane/tree/master/src/games/PIXRACE)

Back a pixel colour.

See if it wins.

### [Professor X](https://github.com/paulcarroll/memory-lane/tree/master/src/games/PROF_X)

Another game started and never finished. I used to get bogged down trying to get artwork to look ok... but that was never my forte.

The game itself was going to be a 2D side platformer, but only the basic left/right movement, shoot and character animation was ever completed.


# Demos

### [Vertigo](https://github.com/paulcarroll/memory-lane/tree/master/src/demos/VERTIGO)
This was at least a decent attempt [at a demo](https://github.com/paulcarroll/memory-lane/tree/master/src/demos/VERTIGO), albeit cheesy, nerdy and embarrassing now.

### [Land](https://github.com/paulcarroll/memory-lane/tree/master/src/demos/LAND)
A point rendered scrolling landscape demo where the land is generated using a plasma algorithm.

### [New3D](https://github.com/paulcarroll/memory-lane/tree/master/src/demos/NEW3D)
Must be better than "old3D" right? 

This was showcasing my new rendering engine with Lambert and Gouraud shading (wow!)... here's the [meat](https://github.com/paulcarroll/memory-lane/blob/master/src/demos/NEW3D/NEW3D.CPP)

### [Waves](https://github.com/paulcarroll/memory-lane/tree/master/src/demos/WAVES)
A nice smooth gentle 2D water simulation that doesn't look too bad.

The water effect was achieved by overlaying multiple sine waves over each other and scrolling them back and forth at different speeds. Definitely one of the smoother effects.

**The EXE is included and may very well still run on [DosBox](https://www.dosbox.com/)**

### [QContinuum](https://github.com/paulcarroll/memory-lane/tree/master/src/demos/QCONT)
[This](https://github.com/paulcarroll/memory-lane/blob/master/src/demos/QCONT/QCONT.ASM) was a text mode assembly demo for a local BBS. A BBS (bulletin board system) is what us old folk used to connect before the internet was plumbed into our devices and hands. They had many modems that you could dial in to and share files. This demo was to promote a local one.

It would have to be one of my more [advanced pieces of assembly](https://github.com/paulcarroll/memory-lane/blob/master/src/demos/QCONT/QCONT.ASM). 


# First Evet Programs

There are a few of my first ever programs here, and it shows. I'm amazed I became a professional programmer when I look at these!

### [BIORHYTHM](https://github.com/paulcarroll/memory-lane/blob/master/src/first-programs/BRHYTHM/BRHYTHM.PAS)
An implementation of this highly spurious "scientific" theory.
