                           -------------------

                                     programmed by Paul Carroll.


   To run this program you will need the EGAVGA.BGI and GOTH.CHR files
included. They must be in the directory \tp\bgi if not the program
will search the default directory. Other graphics drivers can be used
although the Text Justification might be thrown out of whack.

   Also included is the Pascal source code to give you an idea of how
I went about programming the Screen Saver. The saver is NOT a TSR, that
is you can not run it and keep it in memory while in DOS, you can how
ever modify the program and include it into your own program.

   I hope you find it useful and if you have any other questions you 
can leave me message on just about any BBS in the Ballarat area, or you
can write to me at:     

			 P.O Box 22
			 Buninyong,

any correspondence would be appreciated (and donations if you find it
useful) as I am still learning myself and would like to hear of any
improvements you can suggest -
